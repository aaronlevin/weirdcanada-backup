For Edmonton readers, I'd like to remind you that on <strong>Saturday September 5th</strong> Weird Canada will be presenting the The Wicked Awesomes!'s LP release party at Bonnie Doon Bowling Lanes. Music and bowling.

<strong>Weird Canada Presents</strong>

The Wicked Awesomes! "Punk Holograms" LP Release Party!!!

... WITH ...

The Wicked Awesomes! (Edmonton, AB)
Myelin Sheaths (Lethbridge, AB)
Moby Dicks (Lethbridge, AB)
Grown-Ups (Calgary, AB)

Come down to <strong>Bonnie Doon Bowling Lanes</strong> for the one-night-only extravaganza of the year. "Punk Holograms," the debut LP by Edmonton's uber-weirdos The Wicked Awesomes! is sure to be the most talked about record from Edmonton this year. And they'll be coming back from a North American tour that received a huge amount of press, including a glowing review on the Brooklyn Vegan blog!

Joining The Wicked Awesomes will be a weird-punk invasion from Lethbridge and Calgary. We have the Myelin Sheaths, who devastated crowds at the Sled Island Music Festival and will be releasing a 7" on the fabled HoZac Records label (home to Smith Westerns, Blank Dogs, Nobunny, Nothing People, and a host of other underground talent). Tagging along will be the Moby Dicks, whose weird lo-fi garage is sure to turn the heads of folks fortunate enough to catch them now (before they explode - KABOOM!). And coming up from Calgary will be this unknown band Grown-Ups whose MySpace I loved so much I asked them to drive all they way to Edmonton for this show!

***BONNIE DOON BOWLING LANES ::: LOCATED AT 85 st. and 82 ave.(in the bonnie doon shopping mall)****

Yes, the event will take place at Bonnie Doon Bowling Lanes! This is fantastic. Not only does the venue serve beer but it's ALL AGES as well! The lanes will be open all night, so there will also be a BOWLING COMPETITION!! Win radical stuff!

And now for the bands!
