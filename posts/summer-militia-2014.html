<div style="font-size:15px;">As Wyrd Arts Initiatives, our shadowy lizard government, continues to entrench itself in the nefarious marble halls of public funding, mere mortal lizards such as yourself shall reap great rewards. We’ve been extremely fortunate this summer to offer four paid positions within the hallowed halls of Weird Canada. Without further ado, we’d like to introduce you to the next generation of reptilian soldier.
