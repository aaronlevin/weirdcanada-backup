Edmonton, AB has been a great source of inspiration and despair. Desolate winters, northern isolation, and one of the worst public transit systems in Canada breed an unruly class of desperate prairie sky-gazers brimming with creative potential; alas, this disparate, tundradic paradise of the north has captured our eyes for long enough.

In a strategic move of life-questioning proportions, Weird Canada HQ is moving to <b>Toronto, ON</b>. 

Since our conjuring, we've scoured the Canadian landscape searching for sinusoidal ley lines. Medicine Hat? Brandon? Truoro? Sherbrooke? Sydney? Nelson? Perth? Ponoka? Kamloops? Cortes? Possibilities are abundant. But we're leaping into the centre of the volcano and hope to emerge a phoenix: Ontario will be our home for the next chapter in Weird Canada's narrative.

Friends: we are looking for unique partnerships in the hope of creating a more collaborative, supportive, and efficient underground community in Ontario and beyond. We are short on resources and long on vision. If you're interested in working with us, please get in touch. 

To the east, fringeward. 

Hearts,

Marie LeBlanc Flanagan & Aaron Levin
Weird Canada
