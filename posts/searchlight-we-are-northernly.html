<a href="http://radio3.cbc.ca/blogs/2011/3/Edmontons-Weird-Canada-named-Best-Canadian-Music-Site" target="_blank"><u>We won</u></a>. This is not a small victory. This is a leap through hyperspace into a new world order where fringe reigns supreme. We've received the golden nod; the sphinx posed a riddle and you answered. And as our ragged lizard government grants clemency to the wyld sinusoids burrowing within all of us, it is time to acknowledge your monumental role. 

You made this happen. This is our moment. And well shall never forget.

Hearts!

PS - There shall be no posts today. Today we nap. And on the weekend we rise again. There shall be many polemics. And even more exaltation of Canada's underground.
