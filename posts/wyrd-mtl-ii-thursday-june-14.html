We are excited to announce the second annual <b>Wyrd Montreal</b> festival occurring <b>Thursday, June 14 2012</b>! Once again, we have teamed with beloved experimental music festival <a href="http://www.casadelpopolo.com/contents/node/74" target="_blank"><b>Suono Per Il Popolo</b></a> to offer a multi-stage showcase of boundary pushing artists from the northernly fringes. Alongside the returning <b>Mega Merch Bazaar</b> (featuring a selection of Canada’s best record labels) Weird Canada will be taking over both <b>La Sala Rossa</b> and <b>Casa del Popolo</b> simultaneously for a one-night-only cornucopia of sinusoidal delight. This will allow fans the chance to bounce back and forth between the two bars conveniently located across the street from one another. Should fans find themselves needing a respite between wondrous electronics and/or bludgeoning chaos, experimental DJs Aaron Levin and Hobo Cubes will take residency in Casa del Popolo delivering a strange brew of new age, electronic, and avant psychedelics.

<h3>Artist Bios</h3>

<b>Coca Cola (U.S. Girls + Slim Twig)</b> (Toronto)

Continuing Wyrd's philosophy of unique collaborations, we're proud to include a rare performance by this duo known as Coca Cola. Combining the rhythmic polyphonies of Toronto's Slim Twig with the miasmic chaos of U.S. Girls, Coca Cola conjure an arpeggiated ethos of Cluster-inspired jammery. Expect a fantastic array of electronic drone and perturbed psychedelics. 

<b><a href="http://weirdcanada.com/2011/12/video-actual-water-la-violence-sur-les-champs-elysees-director-danielle-nemet/" target="_blank">Actual Water</a></b> (Toronto)

Born in the depths of Ben Cook's (Fucked Up, Young Guv, Bitters) epic space in East Toronto, Actual Water's jangled power-pop transforms their 12-string anthems and insatiable marimba-laced punk into vocal bonanzas and summery attitudes. Every song is laced with their flowering ’60s slacker vibes and live the whole calamity is wrapped by frontman Tony’s enigmatic ‘tude. Stoked!

<b><a href="http://weirdcanada.com/2011/12/new-canadiana-drainolith-you-paid-for-it-bw-deep-water-pa/" target="_blank">Drainolith</a></b> (Montreal)

Drainolith is the multi-throned oscillating 8-bit transmigration of Montreal native Alex Moskos (ex-guitarist for the now defunct AIDS Wolf). Diving deep into polyrhythmic hood jams and clamouring solos of synthetic marvel, Drainolith hams heavy, agnostic experimentalism into a creative vehicle the world may or may not be ready to digest. 

<b><a href="http://weirdcanada.com/2011/09/new-canadiana-energetic-action-walls/" target="_blank">Energetic Action</a></b> (Edmonton)

Edmonton, Alberta is home to many improbable entities, and Energetic Action's revisionist goth-punk paradigm is no exception. Straddling the unknown line between The Pop Group and This Heat, their impossible rhythms and extravagant performances wrap an undisturbed nascency into music hardened by generations of nuclear waste. A certified western anomaly. 

<b><a href="http://weirdcanada.com/2009/10/brave-radar-building/" target="_blank">Brave Radar</a></b> (Montreal)

Local Montreal darlings Brave Radar have kept quiet a long time. So long, in fact, that we reluctantly started to believe their demise. We can barely conceive they’ll be back on stage with brand new oblique pop sweetness.

<b><a href="http://www.myspace.com/boboboutin" target="_blank">Bobo Boutin</a></b> (Montreal)

Ex-Les Georges Leningrad drummer Bobo Boutin inhabits a delirious world of warped electronics. One man, yet an overwhelming performance slowly mounting into a frenzy of nightmarish proportions.

<b><a href="http://weirdcanada.com/2012/03/new-canadiana-dog-day-deformer/" target="_blank">Dog Day</a></b> (Halifax)

Dog Day’s bent alt-rock resonates with grand designs. Seth and Nancy are husband and wife, a charming duo who constantly keep slinging sharp and heavy anti-heroic hooks at every corner.

<b><a href="http://weirdcanada.com/2012/01/new-canadiana-tenderness-the-axe-is-ready-at-the-tree/" target="_blank">Tenderness</a></b> (Toronto)

With bizarre loop sampling wizardry, cracked electronics and sexy sax swoons, Chrissy Reichert redefines any conceivable notions of contemporary R & B. Tenderness is not to be missed, because true originality comes in small doses.
